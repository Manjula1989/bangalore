## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the Netflix titles dataset to gain insights into the platform’s content library. The goal is to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Unsupervised Learning (KMeans Clustering), and Supervised Learning (Logistic Regression) to uncover trends, classify content, and make data-driven recommendations that can help Netflix improve its content strategy.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the Netflix dataset.  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to identify key trends in content types, countries, genres, and release timelines.  
- Use KMeans clustering to segment titles based on duration and year added.  
- Build a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a title is a Movie or TV Show.  
- Translate insights into actionable business recommendations.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Content Type**: Movies make up nearly 70% of Netflix's library.  
- **Country Distribution**: The United States, India, and the UK lead in content contribution.  
- **Genres**: Drama, Comedy, and Documentaries are the most popular genres.  
- **Content Growth**: A sharp increase in new titles occurred between 2016 and 2020.  
- **Clustering**: Helped identify segments like older short-form vs. newer long-form content.  
- **Classification**: Logistic Regression achieved good accuracy in predicting content type using metadata like duration and year added.
